The 'analyze.py' is a Python program to analyze the CSV file which is
the resule of the Google Form of MPI International Survey. 

- Preprocess
In the CSV file, a Mexican guy input his country name with accent.
Unfortunately, Python cannot handle this accent (or simple I do not
know how to handle this).  So, before you begin to analyze the CSV
file, you must edit the CSV file, to remove the accent in Mexico.  

- Analysis
The current 'analyze.py' outputs a number of PDF files each of which
is the graph corresponding to each question in the CSV file.  In
addition to this, the time series graph, the number of answers over
time, will also be output.

- Python program
This is my second Python program I wrote.  Do not blame me about the
Python programming.  Any comments to improve the program are welcome.
