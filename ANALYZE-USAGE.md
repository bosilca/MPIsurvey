The 'analyze.py' is a Python program to analyze the CSV file containing
the result of the Google Form of the MPI International Survey.

- Analysis
The current 'analyze.py' outputs a number of PDF files each of which
is the graph corresponding to each question in the CSV file.  In
addition to this, the time series graph, the number of answers over
time, will also be output.

- Python program
This is my second Python program I wrote.  Do not blame me about the
Python programming.  Any comments to improve the program are welcome.
