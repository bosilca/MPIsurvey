\item Europe:others: I do not develop too many MPI applications, and the ones I maintain do not need too much further parallel optimisation
\item Europe:others: I do not write any but use them
\item Europe:others: I mostly use the same things.  Presumably there are many other things, but I have not really needed those.
\item Europe:others: It would be nice with a standard library of data structures (e.g., hash table with granulated locking/compare-and-swap)
\item Europe:others: Light-weight simplified interface. Perhaps OO C++ wrapper.
\item Europe:others: Modifying old MPI code.
\item Europe:others: No reason to master it. If I propose using something fancy, I also have to demonstrate that it provides a performance or programmability benefit, while not degrading the implementation quality or performance on other MPI implementations.
\item Europe:others: Removed C++ interface, exceptions!!!, int32 for most of counts, displ, etc.
\item Europe:others: The practical details of using a certain MPI in a certain way on a certain system makes a lot of other wise simple things hard (debuggers, pinning, start up sanity, terminal IO, file IO, ..)

\item Japan: Many implementations.
\item Japan: When it comes to a development of algorithms, the strategy of parallelism and  data/domain decomposition has a close relationship. This might make it harder to master MPI than other parallel paradigm.
