Somewhat similar to the previous question~\ref{sec:q25}, but asking more precise
questions, this question tackles the issue on which semantic feature is missing
from MPI. Overall a very similar picture emerges, almost 25\% of the users are
satisfied with the current situation (and there is a high discrepancy between
Japan where users are the least satisfied with the current situation and Russia
which are the most satisfied).

The highest given answer concerns optimization related to communication such as
topology awareness. This is coherent with the previous question and managing
efficiently the topology seem a major concern to many users. Then comes the
concerns about the lack of resilience in MPI, a concern shared by more than 16\%
of the surveyed users. Hiding latency through generalization of asynchrony over
the whole set of functions is another point raised repeatedly. More than 10\% of
the users think that a simpler and easier API would be desirable (a topic where
the discrepancy between different regions is minimal).

Finally, the least desired feature concerns the notion of endpoints, as
discussed in the MPI standardization effort\footnote{missing endpoint footnote}.
However taking in account the extremely technical aspect of this question, and
it's intricate evolution in the standard, it might be possible that most people
answering this question knew little, and possible imprecisely, what this feature
was exactly about.

It is very interesting that most countries concern about the
resilience (as Emmauel noted above). Although there are relatively big
disparity in the satisfaction (answering ``MPI provides all''), the
disparities of the other answers are smaller.
