Related to the previous question the issue on which semantic feature is missing
(apart one related to communication) is tackled here. Almost 25\% pf the
users are satisfied with the current situation (interestingly there is high
discrepancy between Japan where users are the least satisfied with the current
situation and Russia which are the most satisfied, though it is g-hard to draw a
conclusion out of this fact). The highest given answers
concern optimization related to communication such as topology awareness. This
is coherent with the previous question and managing efficiently the topology seem
a major concern to the users. Then comes resilience which is a concern for more
than 16\% of the users. Hiding latency through generalization of asynchronicity
other the whole set of functions is an other concern. More than 10\% of the
users think that a simpler and easier API would be desirable (in this case there
is not much discrepancy among the different regions).  The least wanted features
concerns endpoints. However since it is a very technical aspect of the evolution
of the standard maybe not all the re ponders knew what it was exactly about.
