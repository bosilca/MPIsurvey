The answers given here are not really surprising. We see that the most used
features are the one that are very close the MPI programming model
(communication, and data type management) with 60\% of the answers. We also see
that the forth most useful feature concerns MPI+thread (OpenMP or Pthread),
meaning that programming multicore system is often done by mixing different
programming models.  

Related to the previous question, we see that the most used features are also
among the most known one and that the three less used features (PMPI, persistent
communication, dynamic process creation) are also the less known ones.
