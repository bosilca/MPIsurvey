It is also interesting to look at the users involvement in the selection process
of the MPI implementation available on the platform(s) they use. The outcome of
this question highlights on one side who can impose the use of a specific MPI
implementation and how much leverage the final users has on this choice. It is
interesting to note the overall distribution of the answers matches
relatively well on all regions, indicating a well defined strategy for selecting
the available/used MPI library. Moreover, if we split the answers into users
making a willing choice on their MPI implementation and being imposed one (for
any reason), it become clear than less than 20\% of users have been actively
involved in the selection process of the available MPI library.

\mycomment[EJ]{How do you compute the 20\%?}

In a perfect setting where all libraries are equivalent in capabilities and
performance such a low percentage of user involvement would not be problematic,
as its impact on the scientific and engineering throughput would, at best,
marginally impacted by the users choice. However, taking in account the current
support for MPI features and the well-documented performance differences between
MPI implementations, it is not clear we have reached such a leveled state in the
MPI implementations yet.

\mycomment[EJ]{Can't we also say that in many places there is only one MPI
  installed and that compiling, installing and configuring an MPI implementation
rrequires some skills that not every users have. }.

\mycomment[GB]{Is there a link between the users answer and their main occupation or job location}

\mycomment[AH]{When you look at the cross-tab graph
  Figure\ref{fig:Q1-Q13}, most people have no choice. Considering the
  fact, 80\% of participants belong to governmental institutes or
  universities, this does not make sense. }
