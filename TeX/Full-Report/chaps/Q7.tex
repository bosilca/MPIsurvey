42\% responded from persons working with the
numerical application and library. This indicates that most of the
respondents 
are developing parallel application and library using MPI. Hence they
are at the top of 
the software stack. People working at the intermediate layers if the
stack (runtime, language , workflow, etc.) account for 39\%. Other 
application domains (Big data, AI, image, etc. ) account for 14\%. 

\mycomment[AH]{I supposed to have more people are working for Big Data
  and AI, but this result shows the traditional numerical apps
  dominates. Hmmm, what was the fuss of Biga Data and AI and where do
  they go? One possibility of this is that this survey failed to reach
them. What is the truth?}
