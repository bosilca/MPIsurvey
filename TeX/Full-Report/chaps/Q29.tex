Here we look at the trade-off between performance and portability. In this case,
the outcome is clear? Even if the most given answer is the one in the middle (3)
with 38\%, the tendency is highly towards performance 44\% versus portability
18\%. This may means that the question of performance is more important because an
application is run several time on the machine and that tuning it for performance
is more important than tuning it when moving from one machine to a different one
(as this occurs less often).
