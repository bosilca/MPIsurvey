\subsection{Comments}

There are some MPI features that are not well-known because they are very
specific and/or difficult to use. This is the case for PMPI (that can be used for
debugging), persistent communication (used to optimize repeated communication),
and dynamic process creation (useful when the number of processes varies during
execution). These features represent around  60 \% of the answers showing that
they are very specific. The other answers represent less that 7\% of the
total.  For this question, it is hard to see any difference region-wise.
