This question is about backward compatibility of the MPI API. More than one
third of the users think that this is important that the MPI API keep backward
compatibility from version to version, at any cost. The question of the evolution of the
standard for easier use or better performance is, in total, supported by 30\%
of the users. Almost 9\% do not care and the middle ground consisting of having
a versioned API is supported by 23\% of the users. There is no real discrepancy in
terms of region for this question.

Conversely speaking, 60\% users may accept new, not backward-compatible API.
