This question relates on how developers do program their MPI applications. 

In one third of the cases, MPI calls are put in a special file to better manage
where the communication between processes are done and another one third says that
MPI called are scattered in the program even if the program is large enough. It
seems there is no specific ways of programming in MPI.

It is very interesting that the asnwder of program is 'too small' in
Russia dominates, while the asnwers of 'packing' and 'scattered'
equally dominate in the other countries.
