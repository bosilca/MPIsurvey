This questions relates on how hybrid programming is common within the
developers. 

Only a small fraction (15\%) of the developers have never written an MPI  program
without any other parallel programming language/model. The language
or API the most used with MPI is OpenMP (44\%) followed by CUDA
(17\%). This seems required to manage multicore or accelerator-based parallel
system.

In general, around 40\% of all countries/regions of MPI users
use MPI with OpenMP. The hybrid technique is very common.
It is interesting that the percentage of 'no' answer in US is the
smallest.
