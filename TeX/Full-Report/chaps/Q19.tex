One third of the answers have indicated no obstacles in mastering MPI, a
percentage that seems geographically relatively stable. For the de-facto
standard for distributed computing in HPC this number can be considered
extremely low, and these answers seem to indicate that the standardization
process should be more inclusive of end-users, have better and more descriptive
definitions, and certainly provide better support for the users to discover and
learn MPI.

This is especially true when another third, percentage constant across
continents, consider MPI either as bloated (too many routines) or too
complicated. Of course, understanding MPI is a subjective matter, but that such
a high percentage of the users explicitly targeted by MPI has difficulties
accommodating with the MPI concepts and API standard should be concerning to the
standardization body.

In addition to the checkbox answers the participants were allowed to indicate
additional text to express their concerns or issues wit the current MPI
standard. As expected, while there are as many different answers as answers,
some topics seems to repeat and depict a more clear picture of the current
issues with MPI.

\begin{itemize}
\item Difficulty to debug and assess performance. Lack of tools, which is indeed
  reflective to the ongoing trend in the MPI standardization effort to disregard
  these topics as non essential to the standard itself. Moreover, its has been
  noted several times that it is difficult to evaluate the distance between the
  actual performance and the optimal one. 
\item Lack of documentation, description of the API. These issues are a shared
  responsibility between the implementors and the standardization body, where
  both failed to address and keep in synch with ongoing trends in learning
  strategies. Online documentation and availability of tutorials, such as the
  support provided by some on StackOverflow, would be a welcome addition from
  user perspective.
\item Lack of performance portability, language bindings and new languages
  support (Java, python mentioned explicitly) and threading support hinders the
  adoption. With this it remains unclear what other alternative to MPI the users
  can rely upon.
\item Difference in implementation behaviors, mismatched optimization flags, no
  coherent startup process, lack of performance guidelines are also repeatably
  mentioned as blocking factors.

Many Japanese think the MPI standard provides too many routines, whereas the
answer of having no obstacles dominates in the other countries. In UK and
Germany, the percentage of answer having no appropriate lecture (book nor
tutorial) are relatively small. In UK, however, the percentage of answer having
nobody to ask is large as well as the one of Russia. This situation UK is very
interesting.
