\subsection{Comments}
The most common ways in getting information about MPI specification is to use
either online resources (such as man pages) or to search the Internet. The
common, point with these two sources of information is that they are
dematerialize, which is the common way of working for many developers nowadays.   

Surprisingly, reading the standard (either on the web or with a book) seems to
be quite common as well (20\% of the answers). Last there is no real differences
between regions meaning that the common practice are shared among all the
users. 

% This is the question where the differences among countries/regions are
% hard to see.  I am surprised at that around 20 \% of people are
% reading MPI standard!
