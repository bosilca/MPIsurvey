The main way to access MPI is done by calling the library directly (41\%). If this is
not the case the most current way  of alternatively calling MPI is through
libraries (28\%). Language approaches, such as PGAS or DSL are less used methods
(resp. 14.1\% and 8.3\%).  This means that MPI is mostly seen as a way to program
parallel application and less an environment to be used by runtime systems or
languages.

A fair amount of people are investigating frameworks of libraries
and/or PGAS languages as alternatives of MPI.  UK has the higest
percentage of investigating DSL. In contrast, Germany has the lowest
percentage of investigating DSL.
