This question tries to look at the standard from the opposite point of view,
asking not about the missing parts but about the unnecessary features for the
userâ€™s applications related on the perceived usefulness of each chapter of the
MPI standards for users applications. Unsurprisingly, the least unwanted feature
is the collective operation: this feature is seen as very important and very
useful. Datatypes, communicators and group management as well as  error handlers
received less than 10\% of the answers and are therefore seen as very useful
characteristics of the standard. On the other side, dynamic process creation
received 29\% of the answers. This means that such feature is not used in many
applications and that more generally, MPI is seen as a static programming model
where the number of processes does not evolve during the program execution. To a
least extent, process topologies and one-sided communication received
respectively 12\% and 10\% of the answers. This is not very surprising as these
features relatively specific to special use-cases.

The usefulness of dynamic processing can be regarded from different
perspectives. Without delving into MPI implementation details or HPC center
administration, dynamic processing was certainly always the least, and possibly
the last, supported capability in MPI. This is not a new trend, it was
consistent starting from the moment when this feature was accepted into the MPI
standard. We might be facing a chicken and egg problem, a feature being unused,
or mostly unknown to users due to it's lack of support, or, the opposite, the
lack of support due to user lack of interest. In any case, several recent
studies pinpoint to the need for such feature outside the HPC market.

\todo{It is a bit odd that the most people say the collective ops is useful,
however, 61 people feel that communicators (and group) ops are useless. Does
this mean many MPI users do not create their own communicators?}
