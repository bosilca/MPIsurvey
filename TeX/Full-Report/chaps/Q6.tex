Respondents with over 5 years of MPI program experience 
accounted for 59\% (488/817). In general respondents appear to be less
experienced in MPI than in general programming (cf. Q5), corroborating the fact
that MPI is learned after mastering programming. By country comparison, 
Russia has a well-balanced distribution. Beside Japan has 
few respondents under 2 years, so there may be biased in the 
response or that Japan has not been successful in 
developing new human resources who write MPI programs.
