\subsection{List of other answers}

Looking more precisely at the 27 other MPI implementations specifically
mentioned in the answers, points to the expected dichotomy of vendor's imposed
or delivered MPI implementations, as well as to some lesser known MPI
implementations with an existing, but usually geographically constrained user
base, such as MadMPI with 4 mentions only in Europe:France and ParaStation~MPI
with 10 mentions only in Europe:Germany. Out of them only one MPI implementation
stands out with a more international user base, SGI MPI with 5 total mentions,
all across the world. Finally, for the sake of completeness it should be noted
that some MPI implementations were mentioned at least once (Sun~MPI,
Adaptive~MPI, PGI~MPI, Platform~MPI) as well as a Python API for MPI (mpi4py).

% \mycomment[AH]{I do not think they are geographically constrained, but
% vendors force users to use their MPI. For example, BG/* users have no
% choice but using IBM MPI, the K users must use Fujistu MPI.}.

% \mycomment[AH]{It would be nice to categorize MPI implementations into
% two; proprietary (vendor) MPI and public domain MPI}.

Looking at this list from the perspective of the origin of the MPI
implementation, either public domain or proprietary (vendor) provided MPI we can
notice that about 60.2\% (or 1342 out of 2229) of the answers are using an open
source MPI implementation not provided by a vendor.

\subsection{Comments}

Open MPI, Intel MPI and MPICH dominates more than 60 \%.
