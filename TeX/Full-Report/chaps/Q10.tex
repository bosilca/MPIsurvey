Learning MPI is mostly done by reading the documentation (standard,
internet, 
books). However a good fraction of the answers 40\% have
learned MPI 
through lectures. Interestingly a small fraction (1\%) of the
respondent did not learn 
MPI\ldots Moreover, we do not see any discrepancy by country for this
question. 

It shoild be noted that there are many other answers of 'learn by
doing' and 'reading code.' \mycomment[AH]{Is there any drawbaks of
  learning in this way?}
