In terms of optimization of the performance a small fraction of the users
are satisfied with the current situation. The main requirement concerns how MPI
provides general optimization opportunities in terms of communication such as
being able to handle the topology of the machine efficiently. Then comes how the
to handle multithreading support which a prevalent issue in a world where a
lot of applications are run on multi-core nodes \mycomment[EJ]{here should cross
  Q22-Q25}. Other optimizations such as architecture awareness or dynamic
processing comes third. These issues are not related to the way MPI handles
communications but are identified as a bottleneck for performance as well. Last,
and interestingly almost twice as more users prioritize latency
optimization vs. bandwidth optimization meaning that the overhead in starting to
send one message is seen as more prevalent than the time to send the message as
a whole. Region wise an interesting exception to this is Japan where much more
users ask for bandwidth optimization rather than
latency. 
\mycomment[EJ]{Does this means that Japan machines (K-computer?) have
  known issues in bandwidth or are already extremely good in latency?}
\mycomment[AH]{My guess is that they cannot distinguish bandwidth and
  injection rate.}
