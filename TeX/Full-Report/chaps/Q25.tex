In terms of capabilities of the MPI standard and performance of the MPI
implementations only a quarter of MPI users are satisfied with the current
situation. The main concerns are related to how MPI provides general
optimization opportunities in terms of hardware capabilities such as being able
to handle the topology of the machine more efficiently. This topic is closely
followed by the concerns related to threading support, or the integration of
MPI+X, a prevalent issue in a world where a lot of applications are trying to
integrate node-level runtimes to efficiently handle multi-core nodes.
%
A more detailed view of the missing functionalities emerges from the following questions~\ref{sec:q25},~\ref{sec:q26},~\ref{sec:q27}.
\mycomment[EJ]{here should cross Q22-Q25}.

Other optimizations such as architecture awareness or dynamic processing comes
third, but these issues are not related to the way MPI handles communications
but are identified as a bottleneck for performance as well. This represent a
shift in user awareness to hardware capabilities, and a willingness to take in
account these hardware capabilities in application/algorithm design.

Interestingly enough almost twice as many users prioritize latency optimization
vs. bandwidth optimization meaning that the overhead in starting to send one
message is seen as more prevalent than the time to send the message as a whole,
or put differently users realize that MPI delivers the expected performance in
terms of bandwidth, but lack some in terms of message delivery or extraction
rate.
%
Looking more closely to there results, especially from a region perspective,
pinpoints to an interesting exception to this latency vs. bandwidth discussion.
Indeed, in Japan most users seem to be more concerned about bandwidth rather
than latency. Taking in account the well balance and relatively high performance
in terms of communication capabilities of the last two generations of Japanese
super computers (Earth simulator and the K-computer) compared with the rest of
the Top500 of the same period, this shift in user perception could indicate
either a raising need for bandwidth in the region applications, or an unfounded
perception of the current Japanese platforms.
%
\mycomment[EJ]{Does this means that Japan machines (K-computer?) have known
issues in bandwidth or are already extremely good in latency?} \mycomment[AH]{My
guess is that they cannot distinguish bandwidth and injection
rate.}\mycomment[GB]{Or a middle ground based on a misconception raised by a
strong emphasis by the vendors on a single of these of these issues (similar to
AH comment but shifting the blame on the vendors instead of users).}

It should also be noted that, in a sharp contrast with Japan, Russia is the
country most satisfied with the current MPI standard and/or implementations.
This cannot be explained by the user occupation domain, academic vs. industry,
as most answers received were from academia or government employees.

\mycomment[GB]{unclear if we can/need to explain this}

\mycomment[AH]{I wonder why US users concern about the injection rate
  that much and the least in bandwidth?}

Looking more in details at the different complains few trends emerges, small
enough not to become mainstream yet, but certainly providing an interesting
discussion ground for the future of MPI. In fact some of these trends (such as
resilience~\footnote{https://github.com/mpi-forum/mpi-issues/issues/134,
https://github.com/mpiwg-ft} and large
counts~\footnote{https://github.com/mpi-forum/mpi-issues/issues/80}) are
currently under active discussion in the MPI Forum.

A short summary of frequently appearing concerns is
\begin{itemize}
    \item resilience
    \item large messages
    \item asynchronous progress
    \item better accelerator support
    \item internal statistics to drive further optimizations
\end{itemize}
