Only a few share of the responders do actually check (Mostly or always ) the
error code of the routines  (32.5\%). Most of people do not check error or only
in critical cases. There are several explanation to that : either the fact that
it is sufficient that an error is handled by the MPI runtime system or that
errors return by the routines is not the major source of bug or that the
checking all the errors of all the routine called in an MPI programs make it
highly verbose and hard to read.  


The 'default' and 'never' are theoretically have the same meaning. I
wonder how they distinguished them?

Excepting UK, the 'sometimes' answer dominates. Do they check errors
only at critical points or just fitfully?

In Japan, the 'always' answer has the smallest percentage.  Where is
the uprightness?
