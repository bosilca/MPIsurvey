The 'default' and 'never' are theoretically have the same meaning. I
wonder how they distinguished them?

Excepting UK, the 'sometimes' answer dominates. Do they check errors
only at critical points or just fitfully?

In Japan, the 'always' answer has the smallest percentage.  Where is
the uprightness?
