The support of multi-threading in MPI is done in different ways (MPI\_THREAD\_SINGLE
MPI\_THREAD\_FUNNELED, MPI\_THREAD\_SERIALIZED, MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE, in order of
decreasing semantic restriction). If used the most used option (42\%) are either
MPI\_THREAD\_SINGLE or MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE which are the at the two and of the
spectrum in terms of thread support: most users either want a full support or a
limited support. Moreover, almost 40\% of the respondent have no usage of thread
support in their program. Region-wise, we see that in the USA, thread support is more used
than in other region and the most used option is MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE which is
the least restrictive option. 

This is a multiple-answer question.  In Table~\ref{tab:Q18-mans}, the
number of participants who answered ``I have never called
MPI\_INIT\_THREAD'' and ``I do not know or I do not care'' dominates
close to 50\%  (note that the numbers of answers are shown
in Table~\ref{tab:Q18-ans}). In the rest of the half, the
number of specifying one of the thread level and the number of
specifying two or more of them are comparable.
