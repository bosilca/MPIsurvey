The support of multi-threading in MPI is done in different ways (MPI\_THREAD\_SINGLE
MPI\_THREAD\_FUNNELED, MPI\_THREAD\_SERIALIZED, MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE, in order of
decreasing semantic restriction). If used the most used option (42\%) are either
MPI\_THREAD\_SINGLE or MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE which are the at the two and of the
spectrum in terms of thread support: most users either want a full support or a
limited support. Moreover, almost 40\% of the respondent have no usage of thread
support in their program. Region-wise, we see that in the USA, thread support is more used
than in other region and the most used option is MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE which is
the least restrictive option.
