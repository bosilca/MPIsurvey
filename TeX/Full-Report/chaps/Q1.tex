We got 84\% (698/823) of the answers from college/universities and governmental
institutions. One reason for this is that we distributed the survey using
academic conference mailing list and our personal connections. This also
reflects the user basis of MPI which is mostly used in academia for doing
research and developing parallel code. Efforts have been made to obtain vendor
responses, but we did not get enough answers yet.
