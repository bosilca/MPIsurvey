\input{../inputs/Q1-ans}

We got 84\% (698/823) of the answers from college/universities and 
governmental institutions. One reason for this is that we distributed
the survey using academic conference mailing list and our personal 
connections. Efforts have been made to obtain vendor responses, 
but we did not get enough answers yet.
