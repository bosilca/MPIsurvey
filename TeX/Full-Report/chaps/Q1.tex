\subsection{Answers}
\input{../inputs/Q1-ans}

We got 85\% of the answers from college/universities and governmental
institutions. 
Although there is large disparities on the ratios between
college/universities and governmental institutes among
sountries/regions, the answers from college/universities and
governmental institutes dominate in all countries and regions. 
One reason for this is that we mainly distributed the
survey using 
academic conference mailing lists and our personal connections. This also
reflects the user basis of MPI which is mostly used in academia for doing
research and developing parallel code. 

Efforts have been made to obtain vendor
responses, but we did not get enough answers yet.
