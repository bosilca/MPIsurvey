Concerning the difficulty of writing MPI programs we can distinguish the issues
between (low-level) MPI related aspect (Debugging, performance tuning,
implementation issues, and finding routines) with higher-level issues close to
the program design (algorithm and domain decomposition). The former set of
issues is largely dominant with more than 60\% of the answers. This outlines
that the difficulties of writing a correct program in MPI is more related to the
the programming model and the standard that the design of the parallel program itself. 

This situation varies over country/region. In USA, the higher-level
issues dominate more than 50\% whilst lower-level issues dominate more
than 50\% in Japan.
