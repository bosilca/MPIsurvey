Concerning the difficulty of writing MPI programs we can distinguish the issues
between (low-level) MPI related aspect (Debugging, performance tuning,
implementation issues, and finding routines) with higher-level issues close to
the program design (algorithm and domain decomposition). The former set of
issues is largely dominant with (501/816) 61\% of the answers. This outlines
that the difficulties of writing a correct program in MPI is more related to the
the programming model and the standard that the design of the parallel program itself.
