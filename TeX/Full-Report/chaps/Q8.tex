Corroborating the previous question, most of the respondents are developing
applications. Then comes the MPI ecosystem (debugging, tuning, software
tools). A large fraction is working on parallelization and some are working on
research and development of the software stack.
From a country-by-country comparison, the US 
and Japan are more frequently doing research and development 
of OS / Runtime as compared to other countries.

\mycomment[AH]{Thinking the number of answers from Japan, the high ratio
  of OS/R R\&D comes from the biased distribution of the questionnaire.
  There is an active group which is developing XcalableMP, another PGAS
  language. If we could have more number of Japanese answers, then this
  high ratio could be diluted.}
