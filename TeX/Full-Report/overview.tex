\item{Q20} When you call an MPI routine, how often do you check the error code of the MPI routine  (excepting MPI-IO)?
\item{Q21} In most of your programs, do you pack MPI function calls into their own file or files to have your own abstraction layer for communication?
\item{Q22*} Have you ever written MPI+”X” programs?
\item{Q23} Is there any room for performance tuning in your MPI programs?
\item{Q24*} What, if any, alternatives are you investigating to indirectly call MPI or another communication layer by using another parallel language/library?
\item{Q25} If there were one communication aspect which is not enough in the current MPI could improve the performance of your application, what would you prioritize? Or is MPI providing all the communication semantics required by your application? If not, what is missing?
\item{Q26*} Is MPI providing all the communication semantics required by your application? If not, what is missing?
\item{Q27*} What MPI feature(s) are NOT useful for you application?
\item{Q28} Do you think the MPI standard should maintain backward compatibility?
\item{Q29} In the tradeoff between code portability and performance, which is more or less important for you to write MPI programs?
