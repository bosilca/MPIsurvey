\section{Abstract}

In 2017, ECP\cite{ECP} conducted a survey for MPI users in the ECP
project to reveal how MPI would/should be integrated with ECP
applications in the future\cite{osti_1462877}.  
This inspired us to conduct another MPI survey targeting MPI users in the
whole world. Since MPI is being widely-used vehicle for
high-performance computing for decades, this larger-scale
questionnaire survey would be beneficial not only for deciding the
future direction of MPI, but also the feature differences of MPI users among
countries and/or regions of the world.  Our survey is not only
international but also targeting from novice to expert users, hoping
to be complement to the ECP survey.

This survey is being opened from February of 2019 and more than 800
answers from 42 countries all over the world at the time of this writing.
Unfortunately some countries which are known to be very eager for
doing HPC have very little number of participants. So we decided not
to close the survey until we got enough number of answers from those
countries. 

This is the short interim report based the current results
of the survey. 
In this short report, we focused on which MPI features MPI users
know and which ones do not. This survey reveals that many MPI
users do not use newly introduced MPI functions, such as PMPI, dynamic
process creation, and persistent communication. It must be noted that
those features are not new but already introduced in MPI 2.2
released 2009. The other questions 
reveal that many MPI users learn MPI  via the internet and/or some form of
online documents. Taking account of those results, a possible explanation of
is that many MPI users failed to reach the information about those
MPI features via the internet and thus they are not aware of them.

\section{Survey}

The points we kept in our mind while we were designing the
questions are; a) minimizing the number of questions, b) easy-to-answer,
c) avoiding ambiguity
The questionnaire is implemented by using firstly Google Forms and
later Microsoft Forms, and distributed
by sending e-mails to major mailing lists such as {\tt hpc-announce}. 
All data, a Python program to analyze the answers, and all reports
published so far (including this) are available from a GITHUB page
({\tt https://github.com/bosilca/MPIsurvey.git}).  

Table~\ref{tab:countries} shows the number of answers of top-10
countries. It should be noted that one of the questions asked the
workplaces of participants for recent 5 years, not the nationality.
In this report, the countries and regions (a set of countries)

Most answers, around 80\%, come from research organizations
(universities and governmental research institutes).  We do not think this
diversities did not reflect the characteristics of the countries, but
came from the biased questionnaire distribution. 
Since this profile may bias the analysis of the results, 
readers must keep this in their mind on this background.

\section{Some Results}

Table~\ref{tab:Q10-ans}, \ref{tab:Q14-ans}, \ref{tab:Q16-ans}, and
\ref{tab:Q17-ans} show the number of answers of 4 questions out of
30. Since those questions allow participants to choose multiple answers, 
the numbers in those tables are the numbers of answers of the
corresponding choices. The actual number of participants who answered
each question is noted after the slash (/) of the total number
at the end of each table.

Table~\ref{tab:Q10-ans} shows the result of the question asking ``how
did you learn MPI.'' It is a bit surprising that 40\% (323/825) of
participants refer to the MPI standard. According to the original
data (omitted due to the space limit), one quarter of participants
learn MPI via the internet and/or online documents. 

The result of the question asking ``how do you check MPI
specifications when you are writing MPI programs'' is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:Q14-ans}. More than half of participants refer to the
MPI standard. It is very natural for MPI users to check MPI
specification by referring the MPI standard more often than reading it
for learning. Most notably, the percentage of participants reading
online documents and/or referring the internet occupies 46\% (original
data). 

Referring Table~\ref{tab:Q16-ans} and \ref{tab:Q17-ans}, The MPI
features can be categorized into two groups; well-known ones (P2P,
Collectives, and so on) and little-known ones (PMPI, Persistent and
Dynamic process). Surprisingly this tendency is almost independent
from countries/regions of the participants
(Figure\ref{fig:Q17} showing the percentages of answers over the
countries/regions having more than 50 answers).  

\comment{
Table~\ref{tab:Q16-ans} shows the answers of the question asking
``which MPI features have you never heard of?'' The answers of ``PMPI
interface,'' and ``Persistent communication,'' and ``Dynamic process
creation'' occupies almost 70\%.  The percentage of participants chose
one or some of them is 64\%.  
Table~\ref{tab:Q17-ans} shows the answers of the question asking
``what aspects of the MPI standard do you use in your program in its
current form?'' This question asks the MPI features used by
participants, not if they know or not. Again, there are large gap
between those three features and the other features.
All those features was already standardized in MPI 2.2 which was
release in 2009. Despite the 10-year appearance, those features are
not well-known. 
It is very interesting that the regional differences of the question
asking using MPI aspects over the
countries and regions having more 
than 50 answers 
(Table~\ref{tab:Q17-ans}) are very small as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:Q17}.

\comment{
On the question asking ``how did you learn MPI?,'' one quater of
participants answered ``internet,'' ``not learned,'' and ``other.'' Many
participants who chose ``other'' said ``learned from existing
code,''  ``learned by doing,'' etc. 
\comment{Table~\ref{tab:Q14-ans} shows the result of asking ``how do you check
MPI specifications when you are writing MPI programs?'' }
When we ask ``how do you check
MPI specifications when you are writing MPI programs?,'' 45\% of
participants chose the answers only from ``Online Docs,''
``Internet,'' and ``Asking colleagues.''
30\% of participants chose ``too many routines,'' ``too complicated,''
and/or ``I have nobody to ask,'' when the question ``what are your
obstacles to mastering MPI?'' was given.

\section{MPI users do not use the state-of-the-art API}

Among the little-known MPI features, the persistent communication is
one of the important directions being discussed in MPI Forum\cite{mpi-forum}.
The persistent communication can give implementors a room for
optimization not only P2P but also collective communication
performance. 
All those little-known MPI features already appeared in MPI 2.2
released in 2009. Despite the 10-year appearance, those features 
are failed to get widely accepted.  Why?

One possible answer for this question may come from the survey results
asking participants ``how did you learn MPI''
(Table~\ref{tab:Q10-ans}) and ``how do you check
MPI specifications when you are writing MPI programs''
(Table~\ref{tab:Q14-ans}). 
Here a significant number of participants refer to the internet
and/or online documents. These are handy and allow users to get
required information on the fly. However, 
these online medias can only be retrieved by
search. To search something, a clue or some keywords must be given. 
Someone wants to search something he/she does not know, how can he/she
find the appropriate key words to obtain the right information? 
There can be responsibility of the information providers. For example,
there is no {\tt See Also} link from the man page of {\tt MPI\_Irecv}
to the corresponding persistent routines in many MPI implementations. 

Contrastingly traditional medias such as books, lectures, and tutorials can be
systematic and complete, but not handy.  Once you learned MPI via some
of those traditional medias, you may think that you already know
MPI. Unfortunately the MPI standard is being updated by MPI Forum. It is
very hard to keep your MPI knowledge up-to-date, especially MPI is not
your major concern. 

The other point we noticed is that many people who chose the ``other''
answer to the question asking ``how did you learn MPI'' said
``reading existing code,'' ``learn by doing,'' ``reverse
engineering''(!),  and so on. Taking a look at existing code found on
internet might be the way of learning programing nowadays. However,
the underlying rationale of every MPI feature is never simpler than
any other sequential programs. It is very likely for the novice
programmers writing MPI programs in this way to fall into pitfalls. 

\section{Summary and Future Work}

As the result of conducting an international, large-scale MPI survey,
it is revealed that the uneven perception in the MPI features. Our
hypothesis of this unevenness based on the survey results is that many 
MPI users nowadays learn MPI by searching the internet. If this
unevenness will not be fixed then the new features which will be
introduced in MPI by MPI Forum in the future might also not be
widely accepted by MPI users. This can ruin the large effort of MPI
Forum. 

We are trying to increase the number of participants from other 
countries which are aggressive in HPC.
