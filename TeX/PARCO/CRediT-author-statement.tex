%% CRediT author statement
%% 
%% CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) was introduced with the intention
%% of recognizing individual author contributions, reducing authorship
%% disputes and facilitating collaboration. The idea came about following
%% a 2012 collaborative workshop led by Harvard University and the
%% Wellcome Trust, with input from researchers, the International
%% Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) and publishers, including
%% Elsevier, represented by Cell Press. 
%% 
%% CRediT offers authors the opportunity to share an accurate and
%% detailed description of their diverse contributions to the published
%% work. 
%% 
%% The corresponding author is responsible for ensuring that the
%% descriptions are accurate and agreed by all authors. 
%% The role(s) of all authors should be listed, using the relevant above
%% categories. 
%% Authors may have contributed in multiple roles.
%% CRediT in no way changes the journal’s criteria to qualify for authorship.
%% CRediT statements should be provided during the submission process and
%% will appear above the acknowledgement section of the published paper
%% as shown further below.

%% Conceptualization
%% 	Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals

%% Validation
%%         Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate,
%%         of the overall replication/ reproducibility of
%%         results/experiments and other research outputs  
%% Formal analysis
%%         Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or

%% Data Curation
%%         Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub
%%         data and maintain research data (including software code,
%%         where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for
%%         initial use and later reuse 
%% Writing - Original Draft
%% 	Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published
