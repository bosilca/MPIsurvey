abstractNote = {The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) is currently the primary effort in the United States focused on developing “exascale” levels of computing capability, including hardware, software and applications. In order to obtain a more thorough understanding of how the software projects under the ECP are using, and planning to use the Message Passing Interface (MPI), and help guide the work of our own project within the ECP, we created a survey. Of the 97 ECP projects active at the time the survey was distributed, we received 77 responses, 56 of which reported that their projects were using MPI. This paper reports the results of that survey for the benefit of the broader community of MPI developers.},
